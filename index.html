		Hi there!
		<br>
I am Hue, and I come from Vietnam. I am studying Business Analytic and Information System at University of Iowa. At first, I started school, I decided to take Accounting Major. When I am going to school, I recognize that my technology skill is below average, then I switched my major to Business Analytic and Information System. Hopefully, my technology skill will improve before I graduate.

		I was born and grew up in country side, then go to college in Ho Chi Minh City (the biggest city in Vietnam). The periodic of going to college is the most memorable to me. I met my best friends there who teach me how to cook, show me my mistakes if I do something wrong. we also share experience and story together. Even though we are far away from half of the earth, we still contact each other frequently. My friends and I volunteer at the areas where did not have electricity, people do not have clean water to drink, and children drop out. We walk from door to door encourage the children to go back to school. We also organize workshops about hygiene and sanitation.

		Summer is my favorite season. Summer is great time to spend outside with my sisters, and my friends. My sisters and I take the road trips every summer. The road trips help us explore the nature beauty of America, and we learn how to prepare for travel. I also camping, fishing, and BBQ with my friends in summer. The more I spending my time in nature, the more I realize how important it is.
